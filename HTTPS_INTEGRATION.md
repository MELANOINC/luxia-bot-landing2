# üîí HTTPS Integration Guide - Luxia Bot‚Ñ¢

## ‚úÖ HTTPS Integration Complete

This repository is now **fully integrated with HTTPS** and includes production-ready SSL/TLS configuration.

### üîß What's Been Configured

#### 1. SSL Certificate Support
- ‚úÖ Self-signed certificates generated for development (`nginx/certs/`)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready certificate structure
- ‚úÖ Automated certificate generation script (`generate-ssl.sh`)

#### 2. Nginx HTTPS Configuration
- ‚úÖ HTTP to HTTPS redirection (301 redirects)
- ‚úÖ Modern TLS protocols (TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3)
- ‚úÖ Secure cipher suites
- ‚úÖ HTTP/2 support
- ‚úÖ Security headers:
  - Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Content Security Policy

#### 3. Application Configuration
- ‚úÖ All URLs in `config.js` use HTTPS where appropriate
- ‚úÖ WhatsApp links: `https://wa.me/...`
- ‚úÖ Calendly links: `https://calendly.com/...`
- ‚úÖ N8N webhooks: `https://...` 
- ‚úÖ Quantum AI endpoints: `https://quantum.melano.inc/...`

### üöÄ How to Deploy with HTTPS

#### Development/Testing
```bash
# 1. Generate SSL certificates
./generate-ssl.sh

# 2. Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build

# 3. Access via HTTPS
# https://localhost (redirects from http://localhost)
```

#### Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Replace self-signed certificates with real ones
# Place your SSL certificate and key in nginx/certs/:
# - server.crt (your SSL certificate)
# - server.key (your private key)

# 2. Deploy
docker compose up -d --build

# 3. Your site is now accessible via HTTPS with proper SSL
```

### üîí Security Features

1. **Automatic HTTP ‚Üí HTTPS Redirection**
   - All HTTP traffic redirected to HTTPS
   - 301 permanent redirects for SEO

2. **Modern TLS Configuration**
   - TLS 1.2 and 1.3 support
   - Strong cipher suites
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy

3. **Security Headers**
   - HSTS: Forces browsers to use HTTPS
   - CSP: Prevents XSS attacks
   - Frame Options: Prevents clickjacking

4. **HTTP/2 Support**
   - Faster loading with multiplexing
   - Server push capabilities

### üìã Checklist: HTTPS Integration

- [x] SSL certificates generated/configured
- [x] Nginx HTTPS configuration with security headers
- [x] HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- [x] All application URLs use HTTPS
- [x] Docker configuration supports HTTPS
- [x] Production deployment guide
- [x] Security best practices implemented

### üåê Production Certificate Setup

For production, replace the self-signed certificates:

1. **Let's Encrypt (Free)**
   ```bash
   # Install certbot
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   
   # Generate certificate
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Commercial SSL Certificate**
   - Purchase from trusted CA (Cloudflare, DigiCert, etc.)
   - Place certificate files in `nginx/certs/`
   - Restart docker services

### üîß Environment Variables for HTTPS

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Force HTTPS in production
FORCE_HTTPS=true
NODE_ENV=production
```

### ‚úÖ Verification

Test your HTTPS integration:
```bash
# Check certificate
openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -servername localhost

# Test redirect
curl -I http://localhost

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://localhost -k
```
